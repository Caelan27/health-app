# Health App
## Description
This is an app available on multiple platforms aimed at teaching healthy lifestyles to children. 
I used a Python framework called Kivy to make it.

## Features
Features the app has right now:
* [x] Pages of information on how to be healthy
* [x] A quiz on how to be healthy
* [x] A game encouraging healthy eating

Features I would like to add:
* [ ] Better colorscheme / UI
* [ ] Keeping track of high scores even when the user closes the app
* [ ] A wider variety of items and enemies in the game
* [ ] Better graphics in the game

## How to Install and Run the App
If you have an Android device, you can simply go to the releases, download the APK file and run that on your device.

If you don't have an Android device, you will need to:
- Clone this repository
- Install Kivy (https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/installation.html)
- Run the program with `python main.py` from within the project directory

## Why I Made this Project
This app is for a school assignment. The task was to create an app aimed at encouraging children to have healthy lifestyles.

Although I will be submitting this soon, I plan to continue developing the app anyway.
